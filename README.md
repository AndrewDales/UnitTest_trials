# UnitTest_trials
Examples of using unit test on functions and classes
Also unit tests for Vigenere cipher have been written as an example of test-driven development (see attached worksheet).

## Use unittest on simple functions
- circle_area function
- solve quadratic function

## Use unittest to test dictionary methods
- check_word methdod
- starts_with method

## Use unittest as part of test-driven development
- check the VigenereCipher class methods
